### Hi there! I am Moami Stay âœ¨

i am currently a student at Noroff in Bergen studying Front-End development.
What I enjoy working on the most is the design aspect of Front-End. I fin dusing programs such as Figma and Photoshop fun.

I am just testing out stuff right now... trying to clean up my github account, it's quite messy in here.. hehe

This readme file is definitively not gonna stay like this.
