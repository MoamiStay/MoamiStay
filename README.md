âš¡ Fun fact  
When I was 11 years old, me and my bestie I took part in creating a artwork that  
the queen personally said she wanted to keep. The artwork was displalyed  
somewhere in the royal art gallery (I suppose anyway).  

The name of the piece was "Dronningen og Nerdrum titter pÃ¥ kunst", and  
was part of the 2007 childrens art collection gifted to the queen.
